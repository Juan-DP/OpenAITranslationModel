## Custom Training Setup

When training a custom translation model, having well-structured **context files** is essential. These files streamline the process, helping the model behave more accurately and consistently across different languages.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to test a custom translation model trained using multilingual sentence pairs. The dataset includes translations in several languages:

- **Portuguese**
- **Chinese**
- **Russian**
- **Arabic**
- **Japanese**
- **Spanish**
- **German**
- **French**

Additionally, **contextual information** is provided within the training files to enhance the model’s understanding and accuracy.

## Code Snippet

This repository contains a **testing script** for evaluating the model's performance. The script processes text samples and verifies the model’s translation accuracy across different languages.

### Features

- **Multilingual translation evaluation**
- **Context-aware training data**
- **Optimized for OpenAI's model framework**

## Usage

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/OpenAITranslationModel.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd OpenAITranslationModel

# Run the test script
php test_translation
